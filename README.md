# **FINAL Project - Predicting COVID 19**

### Purpose of this Final Project is to find out what clustering data can tell us about COVID-19 in the United States (US).  

This project is divided into three sections: 
  - Section 1:  Selecting a topic for the project, selecting a dataset based on our topic for analysis, clustering data about COVID in the U.S.

  - Section 2:  Description of the data exploration and analysis phase of the project, which technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms were used throughout the project.

  - Section 3:  The results of the analysis, recommendations for future analysis, and anything the team would do differently given more time.

### **Description:**

### **Section 1:**  (PCA unsupervised algorithm)

  - First we selected our Topic, COVID.
  - Then we selected our dataset from the website [COVID ActNow](https://apidocs.covidactnow.org), "All states timeseries.csv".   
  - We pulled the API csv file, prepared and analyzed the dataset using a Python Pandas DataFrame in Jupyter Notebook; this included cleaning our data, setting an index which separated features for our data to be further analyzed. 

Below shows a cleaned dataset from the original API file and a repurposed version of the dataset for prediction. (examples below of course can change pics, maybe use the dataframe of the principle components?  leads into the ERD?)




Once we wrangled our data, created our connections using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) based on the dataframe above, created a query table using PGAdmin database in Postgres giving a visual table as shown below. (add pics, ERD and table from Postgres? also up for suggestions)
